**Astronomy Flashcard Web Application**

This is an application that serves one purpose. To share, with users, a subject matter that most people find is as  perplexing as it is awe-inspiring.  We give you, the observable Universe on flashcards. Share a moment in spacetime to appreciate your roots and marvel at galaxies, nebulae, pulsars, supernovas, variable stars and much more. These pictures have been captured by NASA satellites and earth bound astrophotographers. Each flashcard contains a picture on the front-side, coupled with a description on the back. Click the flashcard to toggle both sides. In my humble opinion, one of the best features is how users can add their knowledge to each picture and edit each others' pictorial descriptions. Card decks are stacked into subject matters. As the application's scale grows, so will the number of subjects and card decks.
