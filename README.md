**Astronomy Flashcard Web Application**

This isn't a practical application it's a  MAGICAL one!
Generated by coders who enjoy learning, viewing and are passionate about The Universe. Share a moment in spacetime to appreciate your roots and marvel at gorgeous galaxies, nebulas, pulsars, supernovas and much more. These pictures have been captured by NASA satelites and astrophotographers. Each picture is coupled with a descritpion. 
In my humble opinion, one of the best parts to the application is how we decided to incorporate users' ideas, and knowledge into the application by letting users edit eachothers pictorial explainations/descriptions.
