**Astronomy Flashcard Web Application**

This is an application that serves one purpose. To share, with users, a subject matter that most people find is as  perplexing as it is awe-inspiring.  We give to you the Universe, in pictures. Share a moment in spacetime to appreciate your roots and marvel at galaxies, nebulae, pulsars, supernovas, variable stars and much more. These pictures have been captured by NASA satellites and earth bound astrophotographers. Each card contains a picture coupled with a description, just toggle the card and both sides appear. Cards are stacked into subject decks. As the application's scale grows, so will the number of subjects and card decks. In my humble opinion, one of the best features is how users can add their knowledge to each picture and edit each others' pictorial descriptions.
